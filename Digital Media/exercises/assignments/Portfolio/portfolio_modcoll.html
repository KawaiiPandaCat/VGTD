		<p align="center"> It'll be done eventually, but this website is a simple template at this moment. When it's complete it'll be awesome. Right now, though, it's this, as are many other unfinished pages.</p>

		<p align="center">This page will show off all the modules in more detail than the home page. Here the viewer will see examples of projects in each module and can click on those to be taken to yet another page that offers more detail. All the buttons on the side navigation bar will take the viewer to a section of this page.</p>
