		<h2 align="center">This page is under construction.</h2>
		<br>
		<p align="center"> It'll be done eventually, but this website is a simple template at this moment. When it's complete it'll be awesome. Right now, though, it's this, as are many other unfinished pages.</p>
		<br>
		<p align="center">Once completed, this page will feature more detail about external websites I have an account on, like Deviantart, Facebook, and Youtube, which all have other buttons littered around the site (that don't work but shh -- it's a working progress). There will also be links to visit these websites.</p>
